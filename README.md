# Higher Or Lower
A simple version of the Higher or Lower game to learn the basics of Java Programming.

I realize this is too simple of a game to even consider as a GitHub project. But it's one of my very favorite games, and simplest to make. It's like my 'Hello, World!' to programming.

I do have plans on adding a score card as well to the game, to see if you can beat your high score (no. of tries to guess). Maybe it can be the user's choice to set the range of numbers as well.
